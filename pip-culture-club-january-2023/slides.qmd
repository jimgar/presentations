I think it's fair to say that media coverage of the Twitter take over has been 
very focused on Elon Musk and his behaviour.

But in terms of the workplace, those affected most by his actions are the 
thousands of employees. So let's take a look at what they've been saying.

## Employee reviews

:::: columns

![](images/blind.png){height=4.75in}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/)
  - Glassdoor-style site where employees can post anonymous reviews
- Collected the title content of **900 [{{< fa brands twitter title="Twitter" >}}]{style="color: #008849;"} employee reviews**
  - Using webscraping tools in [{{< fa brands r-project title="The R programming language" >}}]{style="color: #063970;"}
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Luckily for us there are websites, like Blind, where employees can leave 
anonymous reviews. So I collected the title content of 900 of these using 
webscraping tools in R, which was really fun because I had never done it before.

## Sentiment analysis

- SA quantifies subjective aspects of text resources, such as emotion, intent 
- I did the most simple version
  - How **positive** or **negative** are the words?
  - Higher values = more positive words 😻
- Plotted alongside the median review rating
  - 1 ⭐️ = poor
  - 5 ⭐️ = great

::: {.notes}
I performed sentiment analysis on the last year of reviews. SA is a way of 
measuring subjective aspects of text, like emotions and intent. I did the most 
simple version, which basically counts up the number of positive and negative 
words per month. And I've plotted that alongside the median review rating, 
which uses the classic one to five stars.

## {{< fa brands twitter title="Twitter" >}} Review Sentiment and Ratings

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;"}
🍊 = sentiment (positive / negative)
🧢 = median rating
:::

::: {.notes}
And here are the results. So, first thing, the orange line is the sentiment, 
and the higher it goes the more positive the reviews have been. Knowing that, 
it's then pretty obvious that the point at which Elon Musk takes over the 
company both the sentiment AND the review scores tank, and they haven't 
recovered as of a couple of days ago.

There's also a blip in July, which is when Elon Musk tried to pull out of the 
purchase agreement and litigation started. That's reflected in what some people 
write regarding uncertainty about the future, and absentee senior management.

## Data {.scrollable}

Finally, if we look at some of the actual examples in the data here. Let's 
focus in on examples that mention 'culture'.
Basically, you see lamentations about how its changed since Musk's takeover.

We can see that people are generally unhappy, and also get some hints as to 
why that might be. You'll get a better understanding of why that might be in
