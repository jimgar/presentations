**Culture Club Twitter Case Study**

*Views expressed in these slides are mine alone, and do not therefore represent Policy in Practice or any other employees at the company!*

Slides for a session of Culture Club at Policy in Practice, Jan 2023.
The data team presented on cultural change at Twitter since Elon Musk's takeover. 
For my section I did a simple sentiment analysis on scraped employee review titles from teamblind.com and presented the results.
The slides were made using Quarto via RStudio IDE using the revealjs format. 
Contains embedded R code to perform and display the SA analysis and underlying data table.
